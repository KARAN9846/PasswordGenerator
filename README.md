# Password Generator using React Hooks

This project is a simple yet effective password generator built using React.js. It utilizes React Hooks such as `useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`, and `useCallback` to manage state, handle side effects, and optimize performance.

## Purpose of Hooks

React Hooks are a powerful feature introduced in React 16.8 that allows developers to use state and other React features without writing a class. Hooks enable functional components to manage state and side effects, making code more concise, readable, and easier to maintain. This project demonstrates the practical implementation of React Hooks in a real-world scenario.

## How Hooks are Utilized

- **useState**: 
  - Used to manage state variables such as `length`, `numberAllowed`, `charAllowed`, and `password`. 
  - State variables are updated using `setLength`, `setNumberAllowed`, `setCharAllowed`, and `setPassword` functions.

- **useEffect**: 
  - Responsible for executing the `passwordGenerator` function whenever there is a change in `length`, `numberAllowed`, `charAllowed`, or when the component mounts.
  - Ensures that the password is generated dynamically based on user input.

- **useRef**: 
  - Utilized to create a reference to the password input field (`passwordRef`).
  - Enables copying the generated password to the clipboard by selecting and copying its value.

- **useCallback**: 
  - Used to memoize the `passwordGenerator` and `copyPasswordToClipboard` functions.
  - Improves performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders when state variables don't change.

## Project Overview

This project provides a user-friendly interface for generating passwords with customizable length and character options. Users can specify the length of the password using a range input and select whether to include numbers and special characters. The generated password is displayed in a text input field and can be easily copied to the clipboard by clicking the "Copy" button.

## How It Works

- **Length Slider**: Allows users to adjust the length of the generated password.
- **Number Checkbox**: Toggles the inclusion of numbers in the generated password.
- **Character Checkbox**: Toggles the inclusion of special characters in the generated password.
- **Copy Button**: Copies the generated password to the clipboard for easy usage.

## Conclusion

This project serves as a practical demonstration of how React Hooks can be used to create interactive and dynamic user interfaces with minimal code. By leveraging useState, useEffect, useRef, and useCallback hooks, developers can efficiently manage state, handle side effects, and optimize performance in their React applications.
